TMA tracking jitter and settling time analysis
##############################################

Abstract
========

.. abstract::

   Several questions have been asked about the TMA performance, including:
(1) What is the tracking error at the InPosition timestamp?
(2) How long doe s the TMA take to settle after the InPosition timestamp?
(3) What is the RMS tracking jitter for a 15 second period after the InPosition timestamp?
This technote attempts to answer those questions.
